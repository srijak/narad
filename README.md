Abandoned.
Messaging app for iOS.

Was thinking of completing but that space is really crowded and this is no where near complete. 

Makign it opensource in case it helps someone.

Things that might be helpfull: how I display contacts, create message modal. Talking to MQTT. If you do want to talk to MQTT, then you prolly want to take a look at the MQTT => mysql auth plugin I wrote for this project: https://github.com/srijak/mosquitto-mysql-auth. 

Please note that neither of these probjects are production quality.
